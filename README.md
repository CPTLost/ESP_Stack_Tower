# ESP_TOWER_STACK THE GAME

This Project was developed for the "Development Board V1.2 zum Buch Embedded Systems mit RISC-V und ESP32C-3" in combination with a 128/64 OLED Screen.

The Idea behind this game is simple. The goal is to stack blocks on top of each other as precise as possible.
Over time the speed with which the blocks travel over the screen increases, which makes it more difficult to stack them.
When you mispalce a block it will be cut of where the block below ends. The next appearing block will have the same size as the top block of the current tower. When you misplace a block completely or miss to place it in the first place you will lose the game and your honour will be deminished for **eternity**. 

I hope you have fun with it :)
